<p>Kidney failure, or renal failure, describes the situation when oneâ€™s kidneys are no longer able to adequately clean waste from the blood.  This can lead to a number of symptoms caused by an increase of waste in the blood, such as nausea, urination issues, swelling of the hands, feet, and face.  </p>
<p>
While kidney failure is usually not reversible, it is often controlled by a treatment called dialysis.  In this treatment, a special machine functions as a filter to clear wastes from the blood.  Dialysis is typically completed several times per week and lasts for several hours.</p>
<p>
In some cases, kidney transplants are available to replace a poorly functioning kidney with a healthy kidney.
