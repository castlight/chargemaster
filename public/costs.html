	<p>If you don’t have insurance or have limited insurance, there are a couple of approaches you might consider to help you pay for your medical need.</p>

	<ol>
		<li><strong>Evaluate the hospitals in your area for cost effectiveness</strong><p>
This database will allow you to search for the ‘Sticker Price (the amount a hospital charges for a specific procedure) and the average amount paid by Medicare (the amount Medicare actually writes in a check to the hospital).  Hospitals with lower charges will generally be more reasonably priced for you if you are paying on your own.</p></li>

		<li><strong>Negotiate your payment in advance</strong><p>
Most hospitals will offer you a “Cash Pay” or “Self-pay” price when you schedule an expensive procedure.  Usually, that price is a 30% or 40% from their normally charged price.  Sounds good, right?  Nope!  The data in this application shows that the ‘Sticker Price’ is often 5 or even 10 times what Medicare pays.  So, when you negotiate, make sure you get a deal that is around or less than the Medicare paid amount.</p></li>
