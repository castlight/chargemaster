        "text": "<p>Kidney failure, or renal failure, describes a situation in which one's kidneys are no longer able to adequately clean waste from the blood. This can lead to a number of symptoms caused by an increase of waste in the blood, such as nausea, urination issues, or swelling of the hands, feet, and face.</p><p>While kidney failure is usually not reversible, it is often controlled by a treatment called dialysis. In this treatment, a special machine functions as a filter to clear wastes from the blood. Dialysis is typically completed several times per week and lasts for several hours.</p><p>In some cases, kidney transplants are available to replace a poorly functioning kidney with a healthy kidney.</p>"
