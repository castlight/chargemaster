        <p>If you don't have insurance or have limited insurance, there are a couple of approaches you might consider to help you pay for your medical need.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Evaluate the hospitals in your area for cost effectiveness</strong>
            <p>This database will allow you to search for the 'Sticker Price' (the amount a hospital charges for a specific procedure) and the average amount paid by Medicare (the amount Medicare actually reimburses the hospital). Hospitals with lower charges will generally be more reasonably priced for you if you are paying on your own.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Negotiate your payment in advance</strong>
            <p>Many hospitals will offer you a "Cash Pay" or "Self-pay" price when you schedule an expensive procedure. Often, that price is a 30-40% discount from their normally charged price. Sounds good, right? Nope! The data in this application shows that the 'Sticker Price' is often five, or even more than ten, times what Medicare pays.</p>
